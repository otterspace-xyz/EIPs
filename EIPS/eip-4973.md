## Abstract

Proposes a standard API for account-bound Tokens (ABT) within smart contracts. An ABT is a non-fungible token bound to a single account. ABTs don't implement a canonical interface for transfers. This EIP defines basic functionality to mint, assign, revoke and track ABTs.

## Motivation

In the popular MMORPG World of Warcraft, its game designers intentionally took some items out of the world's auction house market system to prevent them from having a publicly-discovered price and limit their accessibility.

Vanilla WoW's "Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker" was one such legendary item, and it required a forty-person raid, among other sub-tasks, to slay the firelord "Ragnaros" to gain the "Essence of the Firelord," a material needed to craft the sword once.

Upon voluntary pickup, the sword permanently binds to a character's "soul," making it impossible to trade, sell or even swap it between a player's characters.

In other words, "Thunderfury"'s price was the aggregate of all social costs related to completing the difficult quest line with friends and guild members. Other players spotting Thunderfuries could be sure their owner had slain "Ragnaros," the blistering firelord.

World of Warcraft players could trash legendary and soulbound items like the Thunderfury to permanently remove them from their account.

The Ethereum community has expressed a need for non-transferrable, non-fungible, and socially-priced tokens similar to WoW's soulbound items. Popular contracts implicitly implement account-bound interaction rights today. A principled standardization helps interoperability and improves on-chain data indexing.

The purpose of this document is to make ABTs a reality on Ethereum by creating consensus around a **maximally backward-compatible** but otherwise **minimal** interface definition.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

`EIP-4973` tokens _must_ implement the interfaces:

- [EIP-165](./eip-165.md)'s `ERC165` (`0x01ffc9a7`)
- [EIP-721](./eip-721.md)'s `ERC721Metadata` (`0x5b5e139f`)

`EIP-4973` tokens _must not_ implement the interfaces:

- [EIP-721](./eip-721.md)'s `ERC721` (`0x80ac58cd`)

An ABT receiver must be able to always call `function burn(address _tokenId)` to dissociate themselves from an ABT publicly.

  /// @dev Must emit a `event Revoke` with the `address to` field pointing to

  /// @param tokenId The identifier for an ABT
  function burn(uint256 tokenId) external;
}
```

See [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md) for a definition of its metadata JSON Schema.

The implementor might also leverage the OPTIONAL extension of `ERC4973Permit`, through which `mintWithPermission` is made available. The method allows for minting ABTs only when consent is established between both the parties. The `msg.sender` is the destination address of the token and it is important to note that both the `from` and `msg.sender` (i.e `to`) addresses are authenticated by Ethereum and hence establishes a mutually agreed consent amongst them.

/// @title Account-bound tokens, optional permissioned minting extension
/// @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973

interface IERC4973Permit {
  function mintWithPermission(
    address from,
    string calldata uri,
    bytes calldata signature
  ) external returns (uint256);
}
```

The signature here is of a message digest `MintPermit(address from,address to,string tokenURI)` signed using ECDSA, by the `from` address. Once minted, a user will not be able to reuse the signature to mint additional tokens. Note that these signatures can be generated offchain through libraries such as web3.js or ethers.js and be verified on-chain where the signer can be recovered from the signature (as long as the message digest is encoded according to `EIP-712`).

The implementation also supports [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271), where signatures on behalf of a contract can be verified. For example, in the case of signing via a multisig contract.

The semantics of the signature are as follows:

The signature must be a valid `secp256k1` or [EIP-2098](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2098) from the account mentioned in the `from` address.

```
keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
 hex"1901",
 DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
 keccak256(abi.encode(
          keccak256("MintPermit(address from,address to,string tokenURI)"),
          from,
          to,
          keccak256(bytes(tokenURI))
));
```

where `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` MUST be defined according to [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712). The `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` should be unique to the contract and chain to prevent replay attacks from other domains, and satisfy the requirements of EIP-712, but is otherwise unconstrained. A common choice for `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is:

```
DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(
  abi.encode(
      keccak256('EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)'),
      keccak256(bytes(name)),
      keccak256(bytes(version)),
      chainid,
      address(this)
));
```

In other words, the message is the following ERC-712 typed structure:
```js
{
  "types": {
    "EIP712Domain": [
      {
        "name": "name",
        "type": "string"
      },
      {
        "name": "version",
        "type": "string"
      },
      {
        "name": "chainId",
        "type": "uint256"
      },
      {
        "name": "verifyingContract",
        "type": "address"
      }
    ],
    "MintPermit": [
      {
        "name": "from",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "name": "to",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "name": "tokenURI",
        "type": "string"
      }
    ],
    "primaryType": "Permit",
    "domain": {
      "name": erc721name,
      "version": version,
      "chainId": chainid,
      "verifyingContract": tokenAddress
      },
    "message": {
      "from": fromAddress,
      "to": toAddress,
      "tokenURI": tokenURI
    }
  }
}
```

This EIP requires [EIP-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165). It is further necessary here in order to register the interface of this EIP. Doing so will allow easy verification if an ABT contract has implemented this EIP or not, enabling them to interact accordingly. The interface of this EIP (as defined in EIP-165) is 0x8fac1c1c. Contracts implementing this EIP MUST have the supportsInterface function return true when called with 0x8fac1c1c.

## Rationale

### Interface

`EIP-4973` shall be maximally backward-compatible but still only expose a minimal and simple to implement interface definition.

As [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md) tokens have seen widespread adoption with wallet providers and marketplaces, using its `ERC721Metadata` interface with [`EIP-165`](./eip-165.md) for feature-detection potentially allows implementers to support `EIP-4973` tokens out of the box.

If an implementer of [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md) properly built [`EIP-165`](./eip-165.md)'s `function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID)` function, already by recognizing that [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md)'s track and transfer interface component with the identifier `0x80ac58cd` is not implemented, transferring of a token should not be suggested as a user interface option.

Still, since `EIP-4973` supports [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md)'s `ERC721Metadata` extension, wallets and marketplaces should display an account-bound token with no changes needed.

Although other implementations of account-bound tokens are possible, e.g., by having all transfer functions revert, `EIP-4973` is superior as it supports feature detection through [`EIP-165`](./eip-165.md).

We expose `function burn(address _tokenId)` and require it to be callable at any time by an ABT's owner as it ensures an owner's right to publicly dissociate themselves from what has been issued towards their account.

### Exception handling

Given the non-transferable between accounts property of ABTs, if a user's keys to an account or a contract get compromised or rotated, a user may lose the ability to associate themselves with the token. In some cases, this can be the desired effect. Therefore, `EIP-4973` implementers should build re-issuance and revocation processes to enable recourse. We recommend implementing strictly decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant re-issuance processes.

But this document is deliberately abstaining from offering a standardized form of exception handling in cases where user keys are compromised or rotated.

In cases where implementers want to make account-bound tokens shareable among different accounts, e.g., to avoid losing access when keys get compromised, we suggest issuing the account-bound token towards a contract's account that implements a multi-signature functionality.

### Provenance Indexing

ABTs can be indexed by tracking the emission of `event Attest` and `event Revoke`. To guarantee reliable and implementation-independent indexable information, neither `event Attest` nor `event Revoke` include a `from` argument to depict the transaction sender. Instead, as a `from` property wouldn't be authenticated and hence opens a security vector, we omit it and advise indexers to substitute it with the transaction-level `from` field which gets authenticated through Ethereum's transaction signature validation prior to inclusion in a block.

### Consent

We have made available an extension `ERC4973Permit`, which enables minting of ABTs only when there's active *consent* from both parties participating in the transaction. The primary purpose of this extension is to avoid non-consented non-transferable tokens ending up in a user's account.

### Content Addressability

Account-bound tokens are meant to be "forever tokens" associated to an account, unless otherwise dissociated by the user themselves. This means that not only can the user not transfer ownership, but the minter also cannot withdraw, transfer or change ownership. This includes mutating or removing any remote content as a means of censoring or manipulating specific users. It is essential that the `tokenURI` is content addressable, in order to make this token truly bound to the account without any risk of mutation.

## Backwards Compatibility

We have adopted the [`EIP-165`](./eip-165.md) and `ERC721Metadata` functions purposefully to create a high degree of backward compatibility with [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md). We have deliberately used [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md) terminology such as `function ownerOf(...)` or `function balanceOf(...)` to minimize the effort of familiarization for `EIP-4973` implementers already familiar with, e.g., [`EIP-20`](./eip-20.md) or [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md).
